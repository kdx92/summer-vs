          JavaScript was created at Netscape in the early days of the Web, and technically, 
          “JavaScript” is a trademark licensed from Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) used to describe
          Netscape’s (now Mozilla’s) implementation of the language. 
          Netscape submitted the language for standardization to ECMA—the European Computer Manufacturer’s Association—and because of trademark issues, 
          the standardized version of the language was stuck with the awkward name “ECMAScript.” 
          For the same trademark reasons, Microsoft’s version of the language is formally known as “JScript.” In practice, 
          just about everyone calls the language JavaScript. 
          This book uses the name “ECMAScript” only to refer to the language standard.
          <br><br/>
          For the last decade, all web browsers have implemented version 3 of the ECMAScript standard and there has really been no need to think about version numbers: 
          the language standard was stable and browser implementations of the language were, 
          for the most part, interoperable. Recently, an important new version of the language has been
          defined as ECMAScript version 5 and, at the time of this writing, browsers are beginning
          to implement it. This book covers all the new features of ECMAScript 5 as well as all
          the long-standing features of ECMAScript 3. You’ll sometimes see these language versions abbreviated as ES3 and ES5, just as you’ll sometimes see the name JavaScript
          abbreviated as JS.
          <br><br/>
          When we’re speaking of the language itself, the only version numbers that are relevant
          are ECMAScript versions 3 or 5. (Version 4 of ECMAScript was under development
          for years, but proved to be too ambitious and was never released.) Sometimes, however,
          you’ll also see a JavaScript version number, such as JavaScript 1.5 or JavaScript 1.8.
          These are Mozilla’s version numbers: version 1.5 is basically ECMAScript 3, and later
          versions include nonstandard language extensions (see Chapter 11). Finally, there are
          also version numbers attached to particular JavaScript interpreters or “engines.” Google calls its JavaScript interpreter V8, for example, and at the time of this writing the
          current version of the V8 engine is 3.0.
